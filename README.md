# cybernet-api

The plan is to create a basic character building app for use with OGL Cybernet. I plan on two pieces to this puzzle.
1) This piece, the API. The API will handle all of the work. (CRUD and dice rolling.)
2) The front-end. Front end may consist of multiple pieces. I haven't built or even designed it yet.
